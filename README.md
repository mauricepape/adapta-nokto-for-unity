# Adapta Nokto for Unity
![Screen](https://i.imgur.com/p6kYWHw.png)
"Adapta Nokto" is the name of a GNOME theme originally used in [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/). The inspiration to bring this theme to Unity was mainly kindled by [this Blender theme adaption](https://devtalk.blender.org/t/call-for-content-themes/3174/489).


## Compatibility

**Note: The theme has officially been tested with `2020.3.24` only and was briefly tested with `2021.2.5`.**

Editor version | Compatible? | Notes
-------- | --------------------- | ----------
2021.X.X | Yes, with limitations | _Same as below._
2020.3.X | Yes, with limitations | Some UI elements have the default Unity skin coloring due to the<br>use of UIElements.


## Known Issues
* The code is currently a complete and utter mess. Improvements will be made in a future update.
* There's a huge possibility that I missed some elements. Let me know if you find something!
