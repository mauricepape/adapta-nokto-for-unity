# Adapta Nokto for Unity
![Screen](https://i.imgur.com/p6kYWHw.png)

"Adapta Nokto" is the name of a GNOME theme originally used in [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/). The inspiration to bring this to Unity was mainly kindled by [this Blender theme adaption](https://devtalk.blender.org/t/call-for-content-themes/3174/489).

## Compatibility

**Note: The theme has been officially tested with `2020.3.24` only and was just briefly tested with `2021.2.5`.**

| Editor version | Compatible? | Notes |
| :------: | :-------------------: | ---------- |
| 2021.X.X | Yes, with limitations | _Same as below._ |
| 2020.3.X | Yes, with limitations | Some UI elements have the default Unity skin coloring due to the<br>use of UI Toolkit. |


## Notes
* Adapta Nokto is built with Unity's Dark skin in mind. As such, you'll need to enable it.
* The theme could potentially interfere with UIs from third-party assets! Should you encounter any anomalies, consider uninstalling it and discontinue further use. Do not bother Unity Technologies or developers of third-party assets with any bug reports - customizing the Editor this way isn't officially supported (and likely will never be).


## Known Issues
* The code is currently a complete and utter mess. Improvements will be made in future updates.
* There's a huge possibility that I missed some parts of the UI. Let me know if you find something!
